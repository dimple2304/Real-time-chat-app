Step 1 – backend/config/db.js
Setup MongoDB connection with Mongoose.

Export a connectDB() function.

Step 2 – backend/server.js
Import connectDB() and call it.

Setup Express server.

Enable CORS and JSON parsing.

Create an HTTP server and attach Socket.IO.

Add a simple test route (/api/test) to confirm server is running.

Step 3 – backend/models/User.js
Define User schema with fields:

email, username, password,

isVerified, profilePic, bio,

isOnline, lastSeen.

Export the model.

Step 4 – backend/routes/authRoutes.js
Create Express router for signup, login, and email verification routes.

Export the router.

Step 5 – backend/controllers/authController.js
Write logic for signup:

Validate input, hash password.

Save user to DB with isVerified: false.

Send verification email using Nodemailer.

Write login logic:

Check email, password, and verification status.

Generate JWT token.

Once these are working, you’ll have:

Database connected

User model ready

Basic signup/login with email verification

Then we can move to profile routes and real-time chat.
